Hi Sam, Just to be sure, you are trying to import files with a csv file in WordPress 3.4.x, right? I just tested in 3.4.2 and it worked perfectly. Did you try importing the original template or only a modified version of the file with your own contents. If the latter, how many entries did you have in the file? How large was it?]]></description>

That&#039;s one way to do it. Although not as interactive and immersive as having the user parse your music collection right from your site.]]></description>

So the row count is 0.  And after the import xml script is done running, there is no message saying how many records were imported.  So i guess the problem is getting the information into the DB.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/wordpress-plugins/tune-library/comment-page-3/#comment-871&quot;&gt;yel&lt;/a&gt;.

Thanks so much for the quick response.  Where would I find the tracks table? I can&#039;t find any kind of table under the pluginstune-library directory.  Is it somewhere else?

Hi Roy, before deleting the contents of the tracks table, did you look to check if any records had been loaded into the table? I see that basic output from Tune Library is making it onto the page, but no content, indicating that it can&#039;t find data in the tracks table.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yannick,

First of all, thank you so much for the work you&#039;ve put in to this plugin.  I think the concept is awesome, I just haven&#039;t been able to get it to work.  Please help.  I place the [tune-library] onto a page but nothing shows up.

I have installed the plugin to Word Press and activated it, then included [tune-library] onto a page that I wanted it to go into:

www.soentertaining.com/music/

and into a new page with no other content other than [tune-library]:

www.soentertaining.com/tune-library/

I tried uploaded my library file as an xml and as a csv (deleting the previous database using the &quot;delete imported library&quot; link in the Tune-Library settings page before re-loading.

Thanks,
Roy]]></description>
