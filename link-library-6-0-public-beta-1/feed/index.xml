Just updated to 6.0.8 and the limit of 10 showing per category is happening again. Eg there are 96 links tagged (All Resources) but only 10 show up - http://www.twenty10.org.au/resource-library/

I did a re-import of the links because when I updated it had removed the categories from the links.]]></description>

Sorry - I meant the category drop down menu. Reverted to 5.9 and managed to get everything working fine again.]]></description>

Hi Mish. I have fixed the export issue in a new version of 5.9 that will be out today. I will tag this version as the last version of 5.9, then publish 6.0.

For the separate columns, it may have to do with special characters, but I would need a concrete data sample to reproduce.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There&#039;s an issue with exporting and importing links - the export spreadsheet from the most recent version of 5.9 creates duplicate links for each different category a link is assigned (eg 3 record showing link 1 category 1 - link 1 category 2 - link 1 category 3) rather than what the import spreadsheet needs (link 1 category 1,2,3) - this means when importing I&#039;m getting multiples of the same link. How can I fix this without going through and manually editting the spreadsheet which would take a long time?

I&#039;ve also found the export spreadsheet sometimes splits the link_description into separate columns which pushes data to the left, so the contents no longer align with the columns.]]></description>

Actually, visitor-facing examples of the current beta would look exactly the same as the current example, as most of the new features are on the admin side of the plugin. There is a new link editor, the ability to see links in a paged view instead of all links at the same time, etc... If something looks different after the upgrade, then something needs fixing with the plugin. Once the new version is out, then I will be able to implement new features.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi

I am new to the plugin, I would be interested in seeing some examples of the current beta in action as you have done for the older version.. Also, is it possible for each link to periodically generate a preview image?]]></description>
