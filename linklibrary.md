== Take control of your links and display them any way you want on your site

This plugin is used to be able to create a page on your web site that will contain a list of all of the link categories that you have defined inside of the Links section of the WordPress administration, along with all links defined in these categories. The Admin Panel for Link Library allows you to define up to 5 different sets of settings to have pages with lists of links looking quite different from each other. Please feel free to leave comments, ask questions or report issues on either of these plugins.
