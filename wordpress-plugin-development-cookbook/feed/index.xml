					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/wordpress-plugin-development-cookbook/comment-page-1/#comment-1875&quot;&gt;mzer Mike&lt;/a&gt;.

Hi! Thanks for your feedback. I will try to test this out in the next day or two and give you feedback on any corrections that must be applied to the code to get this to work. Actually, as a starting point, you could even send me your current version of the plugin using my contact form on the site so that I won&#039;t be puzzled if the problem is a typo in your code.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi,
I bought your book WP Plugin Dev Cookbook, and must say it was awesome.

But i noticed that the star counter code for book rating is not working (it displays 5 grey stars by default, but wont display my own star settings). I spent ten hours today trying to figure out why, but has not got a solution. Perhaps am missing something? Kindly help.

Thanks]]></description>
